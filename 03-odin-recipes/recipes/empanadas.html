    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      My original version of the Argentinean recipe for empanadas. Rich and
      delicious. Any meat can be used for this recipe, just be sure to cut it up
      into tiny pieces.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup shortening</li>
      <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Hungarian sweet paprika</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon hot paprika</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
      <li>¼ cup raisins</li>
      <li>2 large hard-cooked eggs, chopped</li>
      <li>½ cup pitted green olives, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Spread ground beef into a large sieve. Slowly pour boiling water over
        top for partial cooking. Let drain and cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, melt shortening in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions;
        cook and stir until just before they begin to turn golden, 12 to 15
        minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in sweet paprika, hot paprika,
        and red pepper flakes; season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer cooled beef to a bowl. Mix in vinegar and cumin and season with
        salt. Mix in onions until well combined. Transfer to a large plate to
        cool and harden, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut puff pastry dough into 10 circles. Place a spoonful meat mixture
        onto each round, making sure at least 1/2 inch of the outer pastry edge
        stays clean and dry. Add olives, raisins, and hard-cooked eggs to each
        round. Slightly wet the edges of pastry rounds, fold in half into
        half-moons, and press the edges together. Seal empanadas by twisting and
        curling dough together between your thumb and index finger, adding
        pressure before releasing each pinch and moving on to the next one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place empanadas onto the prepared baking sheet. Prick each empanada with
        a fork near the curled edge to allow steam to escape during baking.
        Brush empanadas with beaten egg.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
